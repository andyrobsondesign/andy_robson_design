				<h4>About Me</h4>
				<p>Hello! Welcome to Andy Robson Design.  I'm Bobbi.  Who is Andy Robson you may ask?  Well, Andy Robson is a combination of people.  Andy is in honor of my grandfather "Andy" Anderson as well as my maternal grandmother.  The Robson portion of the name come from both my parents and paternal grandmother.  All of these people have taught me the importance of honor, honesty, and integrity which is the foundation of Andy Robson Design.  They've taught me to follow my dreams, pursue my passions, and believe that anything is possible if you work hard. This is not only the foundation of Andy Robson Design but also what I hope to help others realize in their own lives.
